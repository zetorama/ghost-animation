		<p>Hey, hey, hey! It's Fat Albert! Now I'm gonna sing a song for you, and this is gonna show you a thing or two. You'll have some fun now With me and the gang, learning from each other While we do our thing. Na na na gonna have a good time! Na na na gonna have a good time! Hey, hey, hey! This is Bill Cosby coming out with music and fun and if you're not careful, you may learn something before it's done! Hey, hey, hey!</p>

		<p>Making your way in the world today takes everything you've got. Taking a break from all your worries, sure would help a lot. Wouldn't you like to get away? Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name, and they're always glad you came. You wanna be where you can see, our troubles are all the same. You wanna be where everybody knows your name. You wanna go where people know, people are all the same, you wanna go where everybody knows your name.</p>

		<p>Wally Gator is a swinging alligator in the swamp. He's the greatest percolator when he really starts to romp. There has never been a greater operator in the swamp. See ya later, Wally Gator.</p>

		<p>Now, the world don't move to the beat of just one drum, what might be right for you, may not be right for some. A man is born, he's a man of means. Then along come two, they got nothing but their jeans. But they got, Diff'rent Strokes, it takes Diff'rent Strokes. It takes Diff'rent Strokes to move the world.</p>

		<p>Enter at your peril, past the vaulted door. Impossible things will happen that the world's never seen before. In Dexter's laboratory lives the smartest boy you've ever seen, but Dee Dee blows his experiments to Smithereens! There's gloom and doom when things go boom in Dexter's lab!</p>

		<p>Welcome back, your dreams were your ticket out. Welcome back, to that same old place that you laughed about. Well, the names have all changed since you hung around, but those dreams have remained and they're turned around. Who'd have thought they'd lead ya? Here where we need ya. Yeah, we tease him a lot 'cause we've got him on the spot, welcome back. Welcome back, welcome back, welcome back.</p>

		<p>He was once a little green slab of clay. Gumby! You should see what Gumby can do today. Gumby! He can walk into any book, with his pony pal Pokey, too. If you've got a heart then Gumby's a part of you.</p>
